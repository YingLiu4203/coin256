## ‚úçÔ∏è Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- **Clear and accessible**: Write for a broad audience
- **Technically accurate**: Verify facts and examples
- **Consistent**: Match the style of existing content
- **Well-structured**: Use headers, lists, and formatting effectively

### Chapter Structure
Each chapter should follow this structure:
```
chapter-XX-name/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Main chapter content
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/            # Screenshots, diagrams, illustrations
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/          # Code examples, demos, data files
```

### Markdown Formatting
- Use `#` for main chapter title (H1)
- Use `##` for major sections (H2)
- Use `###` for subsections (H3)
- Use code blocks with language specification:
  ````markdown
  ```python
  # Your code here
  ```
  ````
- Use tables for structured data
- Use lists for sequential or related items

### Adding Images
1. Place images in the chapter's `images/` folder
2. Use descriptive filenames: `hash-function-diagram.png`
3. Reference in markdown: `![Description](./images/filename.png)`
4. Optimize image size (prefer PNG for diagrams, JPG for photos)

### Code Examples
1. Place code files in the chapter's `examples/` folder
2. Include comments explaining the code
3. Test all code examples to ensure they work
4. Specify language and dependencies clearly
